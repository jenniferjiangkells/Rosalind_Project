# Problem: 04_Rabbits and Recurrence Relations
# Link: http://rosalind.info/problems/fib/
# Given: Positive integers n≤40 and k≤5.
# Return: The total number of rabbit pairs that will be present after n months, if we begin with 1 pair and in each generation, every pair of reproduction-age rabbits produces a litter of k rabbit pairs (instead of only 1 pair).

n = 36
k = 3

fib1 = 1
fib2 = 1

if n > 2:
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        temp = fib2
        fib2 = fib1*k + fib2
        fib1 = temp

print(fib2)
